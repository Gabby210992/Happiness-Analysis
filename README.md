# Happiness and Well Being Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analysis the trend in happiness and well-being using a world happiness report data. While other approaches and techniques can be used for this project, I employed pandas and matplotlib for the purpose of accessing my studies on the aforementioned topics.

### [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-happiness-scores-and-factors)
World Happiness Report: The [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xCeoWcobQnKmms2UatMuvwjDC1Z3PAxP/view?usp=drive_link) was downloaded from kaggle.com

### Project Objective
My objective is to examine factors that influence happiness across different countries and regions, identify key drivers of well-being, and uncover patterns that highlight how various social, economic, and environmental factors contribute to overall happiness worldwide.

### Tools
The main tool used for this project is Acaconda installed through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
**The following python libraries were used:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Data Cleaning/preparation
In the initial data preparatory phase, I performed the following task
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values and
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA involves exploring the World Happiness Report data to answer key questions such as 
- What are the top 10 happiest and least happy countries?
- How does happiness score vary across regions?
- Is there a correlation between GDP per capita and happiness score?
- What is the distribution of social support across countries?
- How does healthy life expectancy impact happiness across regions?
- Which regions have the highest perceptions of corruption?
- Is there a link between generosity and happiness?
- How does the freedom to make life choices relate to happiness?
- What are the averages for each metric across regions?
- Which countries deviate the most from the regional average happiness score?
